# Quarter-end Reflction for the 1st Quarter!

##  5 topics that we discussed in class that I know very well
* Loop Control Structures because it's super useful because allows me to repeat a block of code without copying and pasting the same thing over and over again. It also easy to understand because of the lessons that I had back in gr8 and with the amount of exercises I did this quarter. 
* HTML & CSS because it's easy for me to understand. It also straight forward and it's not so hard to complex to understand. It's also because I was able to practice and practice it when putting designs in my exercises and even my portfolio.
* Switch Statements in JavaScript, again it's easier for me to understand. For me, it's more organized and cleaner and it's an easier alternative to long if-else chains. It's also because it's very similar to my gr8 lessons in C++.
* Functions because I was able to practice and practice it before the school year starts. It's also very easy and simple for me to understand.
* If else statements in JavaScript because I was able t opractice and practice it back in grade 8. I also often use it when I do my my exercises making it easier for me to master and understand.

## 5 topics that I know and can describe but need further practice/discussion and why.
* Arrays because there are times where the first element is at index 0 and not 1 which is quite stressful to fix. Also the mutating and non-mutating methods where some methods change the orginal array vs where the others return a new array, for me it's quite confusing.
* For me, I need further discussions on parseInt and parseFloat. I understand it's meaning but I need a more clearer analysis on it, and a little bit more practice on it.
* For me, a bit about arithmetic operators. Based from my Part 1- LT scores, I've gotten quite a low score.. While the coverage is mostly about arithmetic operators, I want to practice on that. Like an example is probably about the difference between "10" === 10 or "10" == 10. If they are the same or not :D because it was really confusing for me.
* Another one I want to point out, is about the MathRandom. I was able to understand it while making the code, but it feels like I need more practice about it because, I didn't fully grasp it.
* The last one is about logic operators. I want to grasp the understanding of it, because it's quite confusing for me. Sometimes I get confused if it means the same thing or the complete opposite, like for example, if the value will return true or false, because I remembered that Javascript is not really that strict when returning values. ^^ 

## Plan of action in order to help myself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
I need more practice exercise regarding the topics I don't understand. For me I didn't use arrays in most of my exercises, so I wish to have a required exercises that needs arrays. I also want to have a few more practices about arithmetic oprators and other predefined variables to really help me grasp my understanding about it.

## 3 effective activities I did in class and 3 not effective activites in helping me understand the topics in the course and why.
Actually, all the activities that we did were very effective for me. Each activity we did in class or at home, really helped me strengthen my muscle memory in making different kinds of websites using html and css. For javascript, different practices we did in class and at home were also helpful since what we learned and studied appeared in the exam! :D
