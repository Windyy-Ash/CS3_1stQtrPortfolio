## Quarter-end Reflction for the 1st Quarter!

#  5 topics that we discussed in class that I know very well
* Loop Control Structures 
* HTML & CSS
* Switch Statements in JavaScript
* Functions
* If else statements in JavaScript

# 5 topics that I know and can describe but need further practice/discussion and why.
* Arrays because there are times where the first element is at index 0 and not 1 which is quite stressful to fix. Also the mutating and non-mutating methods where some methods change the orginal array vs where the others return a new array, for me it's quite confusing.
* For me, I need further discussions on parseInt and parseFloat. I understand it's meaning but I need a more clearer analysis on it, and a little bit more practice on it.
* For me, a bit about arithmetic operators. Based from my Part 1- LT scores, I've gotten quite a low score.. While the coverage is mostly about arithmetic operators, I want to practice on that. Like an example is probably about the difference between "10" === 10 or "10" == 10. If they are the same or not :D because it was really confusing for me.
* Another one I want to point out, is about the MathRandom. I was able to understand it while making the code, but it feels like I need more practice about it because, I didn't fully grasp it.
* So far, those are the only topics I really don't really understand much or didn't fully grasp. I can't find anymore topics that I really don't understand. The rest I fully understand and am confident about! ^^ 

# Plan of action in order to help myself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
I need more practice exercise regarding the topics I don't understand. For me I didn't use arrays in most of my exercises, so I wish to have a required exercises that needs arrays. I also want to have a few more practices about arithmetic oprators and other predefined variables to really help me grasp my understanding about it.

# 3 effective activities I did in class and 3 not effective activites in helping me understand the topics in the course and why.
Actually, all the activities that we did were very effective for me. Each activity we did in class or at home, really helped me strengthen my muscle memory in making different kinds of websites using html and css. For javascript, different practices we did in class and at home were also helpful since what we learned and studied appeared in the exam! :D
