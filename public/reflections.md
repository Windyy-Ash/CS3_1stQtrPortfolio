## Quarter-end Reflction for the 1st Quarter!

#  5 topics that we discussed in class that I know very well
* Loop Control Structures 
* HTML & CSS
* Switch Statements in JavaScript
* Functions
* If else statements in JavaScript

# 5 topics that I know and can describe but need further practice/discussion and why.
* Arrays because there are times where the first element is at index 0 and not 1 which is quite stressful to fix. Also the mutating and non-mutating methods where some methods change the orginal array vs where the others return a new array, for me it's quite confusing.
* For me, I need further discussions on parseInt and parseFloat. I understand it's meaning but I need a more clearer analysis on it, and a little bit more practice on it.
* 

# Plan of action in order to help myself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.


# 3 effective activities I did in class and 3 not effective activites in helping me understand the topics in the course and why.
