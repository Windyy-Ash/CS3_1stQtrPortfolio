### Reflection 
During the SONA 2025, President Marcos talked about many different achievements he made to improve our country. Like about our economy, agriculture, the wellness and cleanliness of the Filipinos. He talked about the mental health of the students, cleaning the water supply for the nation and also for the slums. He also explained about his infrastructure projects under the "Build Better More" program, where he explain about the MRT. He also talked about his deeds to the Filipinos by installing 2 and a half million people electricity inside thier homes, and giving more job oppurtunities to them. Despite him talking and focusing about the economy and his projects, he did not mention anything about our sewage systems and the flooding that was created by three typhoons. The typhoons has caused mass destruction around the nation where lots of people lost their lives and homes. A big cause of these was because of the floods and landslides that happened during the typhoon. Overall, the SONA 2025 highlighted many good things that the government was doing, it's quite sad that he didn't talk about any solutions to the problems that we face every rainy season, like the typhoons, floods, landslides etc.

### One word to the Philippines
#### Good Luck!
